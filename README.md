- What app would I like to build? 
    One feature of an app that I would like to build is to allow for Youtube videos to contain a "transcript" tab, which will record what the speaker says at a designated time. I got this idea from my personal experience using educational sites such as Khan Academy, where videos have a transcript tab. Then, I considered that Youtube is a very visual/audio driven application, and is used worldwide, so there will be occasions in which the content creator may speak with an accent that viewers may have trouble understanding, or they may not understand the language. However, by giving transcripts the viewer may understand exactly what word is said and in the case of different languages, in my mind, it would be possible to select the body of text at a given time, and press on a "translate" option.
